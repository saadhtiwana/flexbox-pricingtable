# Learning Flexbox with a Pricing Table

This project is a simple pricing table designed using **Flexbox**. The primary goal of this exercise was to practice and understand how Flexbox works for creating responsive and visually appealing layouts.

## Features
- Three pricing plans: **Undergraduate**, **Graduate**, and **Postgraduate** (university-themed).
- Fully responsive design using media queries and Flexbox.
- Clean and minimal UI with a focus on structure and alignment.
- Use of Google Fonts for better typography.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Fonts**: To enhance the typography.

## What I Learned
